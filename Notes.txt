assume fixed-wing vs. quadrotor
radar input with recursive ransack
#class of intruders
	initialize (position, velocity)
	rotation matrices, trajectories	
	hold min turn radius
	return trajectory
class ownship (min radius, parameters)

#graph everything in 3D:


keep code organized and relevant
#simplify code by running main function that calls how many intruders
#create function for random position
#create function for random velocity
#add mesh of drone
#set ownship initial position and velocity
#eliminate duplicate intruders on each position



create "shadow" of previous locations
create collision volume
create self-separation volume
create functionality alerting if any volumes interfered

add mesh of intruder vehicles
add various colors for intruders
